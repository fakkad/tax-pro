## Source Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)

When researching tax rules, the authority of the source matters. Courts and the IRS follow this hierarchy:

### Tier 1: Primary Authority (Binding)

| Source | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Internal Revenue Code (IRC)** | The law itself, enacted by Congress | IRC § 401(k), IRC § 121 |
| **Treasury Regulations** | IRS interpretations of the Code, carry force of law | Treas. Reg. § 1.162-5 |
| **Supreme Court Decisions** | Highest court rulings on tax matters | Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass |

### Tier 2: Administrative Guidance (Strong)

| Source | Description | Reliance |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Revenue Rulings** | IRS position on specific fact patterns, published in IRB | Can be cited as precedent |
| **Revenue Procedures** | IRS administrative procedures | Procedural guidance |
| **Notices** | IRS guidance on new issues, often precedes regulations | Generally reliable |
| **Announcements** | Less formal IRS statements | Informational |

### Tier 3: Case-Specific Guidance (Limited)

| Source | Description | Reliance |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Private Letter Rulings (PLRs)** | IRS ruling on specific taxpayer's situation | Only binding for that taxpayer |
| **Technical Advice Memoranda (TAMs)** | IRS guidance to agents during audits | Limited precedential value |
| **Chief Counsel Advice (CCAs)** | Legal advice from IRS Chief Counsel | Insight into IRS thinking |

### Tier 4: Secondary Sources (Interpretive)

| Source | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **IRS Publications** | Plain-English explanations (Pub 17, Pub 535, etc.) |
| **IRS Instructions** | Form-specific guidance |
| **Tax Court Decisions** | Lower court precedent |
| **Tax Services** (CCH, RIA, BNA) | Professional research tools |

## Citation Standards

When providing tax advice, cite sources at the appropriate level:

**For general guidance:**
> "HSA contribution limits for 2025 are $4,300 (self) / $8,550 (family) per IRS Pub 969."

**For specific rules:**
> "The home sale exclusion under IRC § 121 allows up to $250,000 ($500,000 MFJ) of gain exclusion."

**For complex situations:**
> "Treasury Regulation § 1.469-4 provides the rules for grouping passive activities."
