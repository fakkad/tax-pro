## White Space / Opportunities

1. **Forward-looking advice for individuals** — Range does this but at $6K/yr. No affordable option.

2. **CPA prep (not replacement)** — Most tools either file or are for CPAs. Nothing in between.

3. **Strategy engine for non-professionals** — Hive Tax has 100+ strategies but it's for CPAs. Surface this to individuals.

4. **Life event triggers** — "You got married" → automatic strategy review. Not well-served.

5. **State-specific optimization** — Multi-state filers underserved.

6. **Privacy-first local processing** — Most require cloud upload. Claude Code is local.
