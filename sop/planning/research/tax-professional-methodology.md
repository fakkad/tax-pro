| Compliance focus | Strategy focus |
| Annual engagement | Year-round relationship |
| Form-filling | Financial planning integration |
| Generic advice | Situation-specific optimization |

## Elite Tax Professional Framework

### 1. Holistic Intake (Not Just Forms)

Elite professionals don't just collect tax documents — they understand the client's entire financial picture:

**Beyond the Forms:**
- Career trajectory and expected income changes
- Life events (marriage, kids, retirement, inheritance)
- Business ownership and entity structure
- Investment philosophy and portfolio composition
- Real estate holdings and plans
- Estate planning status
- Insurance coverage
- Charitable intentions

**Key Questions Elite CPAs Ask:**
- "What changed this year?" (life events trigger opportunities)
- "What's happening next year?" (forward-looking planning)
- "What are your 3-5 year goals?" (multi-year optimization)
- "What keeps you up at night financially?" (identifies priorities)

### 2. Multi-Year Perspective

Elite tax planning isn't annual — it's multi-year optimization:

**Income Timing:**
- Accelerate/defer income based on bracket expectations
- Roth conversion ladders during low-income years
- Capital gain harvesting in 0% bracket years
- Bunching strategies (charitable, medical)

**Bracket Management:**
- Project AGI across years
- Identify "bracket arbitrage" opportunities
- Plan for known income spikes (RSU vests, property sales)

### 3. Entity Structure Optimization

**Questions Elite CPAs Evaluate:**
- Is self-employment income high enough for S-Corp election?
- Would an LLC provide liability protection and tax benefits?
- Is there rental activity that should be in a separate entity?
- Are family members involved who could be hired?

**Common Recommendations:**
- S-Corp for $50K+ self-employment (SE tax savings)
- LLC for rental properties (liability + flexibility)
- Family employment for income shifting (within rules)
- Trust structures for estate planning

### 4. Retirement Account Maximization

Elite approach goes beyond "max your 401k":

**Layered Optimization:**
1. Contribute to 401k match threshold (free money)
2. Max HSA (triple tax advantage)
3. Evaluate Roth vs Traditional based on future bracket
4. Back-door Roth for high earners
5. Mega back-door Roth if plan allows
6. SEP/Solo 401k for self-employment income

**Key Calculations:**
- Tax-equivalent contribution value
- Roth conversion breakeven analysis
- Required Minimum Distribution projections

### 5. Loss Harvesting & Gain Management

**Year-Round Monitoring:**
- Identify tax-loss harvesting opportunities before year-end
- Match gains with losses strategically
- Avoid wash sale rule violations
- Consider specific identification vs FIFO

**Capital Gain Planning:**
- Hold periods for long-term treatment
- 0% LTCG bracket optimization
- Installment sales for large gains
- Qualified Opportunity Zone deferrals

### 6. Deduction Optimization

**Bunching Strategy:**
- Alternate years of itemizing vs standard deduction
- Bunch charitable contributions (DAF in high-income year)
- Bunch medical expenses (elective procedures)
- Prepay property taxes in itemizing years

**Above-the-Line Priorities:**
- HSA (reduces AGI)
- Student loan interest
- Self-employment deductions
- IRA contributions

### 7. Credit Awareness

**Commonly Missed Credits:**
- Saver's Credit (low-income retirement contributions)
- Child Tax Credit phase-outs and planning
- Education credits (AOTC vs Lifetime Learning)
- Energy credits (home improvements, EV)
- Foreign Tax Credit (international investments)

### 8. State Tax Arbitrage

**Multi-State Optimization:**
- Remote work allocation rules
- Domicile vs residence distinctions
- State-specific deductions and credits
- Reciprocity agreements

**Relocation Planning:**
- No-income-tax state considerations
- Timing of moves for tax efficiency
- State treatment of retirement income

## The Elite CPA Workflow

### Quarterly Touchpoints

| Quarter | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Q1** | Prior year filing + current year planning kickoff |
| **Q2** | Mid-year projection, estimated payment review |
| **Q3** | Year-end planning strategy development |
| **Q4** | Execute year-end moves (contributions, harvesting, conversions) |

### Year-End Checklist (What Elite CPAs Do in Q4)

1. **Project final AGI** with reasonable accuracy
2. **Calculate bracket headroom** (room before next bracket)
3. **Review retirement contributions** (maximize HSA, 401k)
4. **Assess Roth conversion opportunity** (fill up current bracket)
5. **Harvest tax losses** in taxable accounts
6. **Review charitable giving** (bunch or DAF contribution)
7. **Accelerate/defer income** based on projection
8. **Review estimated payments** (avoid penalty)
9. **Check for expiring provisions** (tax law changes)
10. **Document planning decisions** for future reference
