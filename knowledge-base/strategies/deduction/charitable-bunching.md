# Charitable Bunching Strategy

## Why This Strategy Matters

The 2017 tax law nearly doubled the standard deduction, making itemizing harder. Charitable bunching lets you:

- **Concentrate multiple years of donations** into one year
- **Exceed the standard deduction** in bunching year
- **Take standard deduction** in other years
- **Net more total deductions** over time

## The Problem

2025 Standard Deduction:
- Single: $15,000
- MFJ: $30,000

If your itemized deductions (SALT, mortgage interest, charitable) barely exceed the standard deduction, you're leaving value on the table.

## The Solution: Bunching

Instead of giving $10,000/year every year:
- **Year 1**: Give $30,000 (3 years of donations)
- **Year 2**: Give $0, take standard deduction
- **Year 3**: Give $0, take standard deduction
- Repeat

## Example Comparison

**Without bunching** (give $10K/year):
| Year | Charitable | Other Itemized | Total | Use | Deduction |
|------|------------|----------------|-------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | $10,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | Standard | $30,000 |
| 2 | $10,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | Standard | $30,000 |
| 3 | $10,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | Standard | $30,000 |
| **Total** | | | | | **$90,000** |

**With bunching** (give $30K in Year 1):
| Year | Charitable | Other Itemized | Total | Use | Deduction |
|------|------------|----------------|-------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | $30,000 | $15,000 | $45,000 | Itemize | $45,000 |
| 2 | $0 | $15,000 | $15,000 | Standard | $30,000 |
| 3 | $0 | $15,000 | $15,000 | Standard | $30,000 |
| **Total** | | | | | **$105,000** |

**Extra deduction**: $15,000 → at 32% bracket = **$4,800 tax savings**

## Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)

A DAF makes bunching practical:

1. **Contribute lump sum** to DAF (get deduction immediately)
2. **Invest and grow** tax-free
3. **Distribute to charities** over time as you choose

**Providers**: Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable, Vanguard Charitable

**Minimums**: Usually $5,000 to open

## Appreciated Stock Strategy

Donating appreciated stock to a DAF is even better:

1. **Deduct full market value** (not just cost basis)
2. **Avoid capital gains tax** on appreciation
3. **Double benefit**: Deduction + avoided tax

Example:
- Stock: $20,000 value, $5,000 basis
- Donate stock: $20,000 deduction, $0 capital gains tax
- Sell and donate cash: $20,000 deduction, but $15,000 × 15% = $2,250 LTCG tax

**Extra savings**: $2,250 by donating stock directly

## Action Steps

1. **Calculate your itemized deductions** without charitable
2. **Determine bunching benefit** — are you close to standard deduction threshold?
3. **Open a DAF** if you'll bunch $5K+
4. **Contribute by Dec 31** for current year deduction
5. **Distribute to charities** whenever you want

## Contribution Limits

| Asset Type | AGI Limit |
|------------|-----------|
| Cash | 60% of AGI |
| Appreciated stock | 30% of AGI |
| Excess | Carries forward 5 years |

## Special Cases

### QCD (Age 70½+)
Qualified Charitable Distributions directly from IRA:
- Up to $105,000 (2025)
- Counts toward RMD
- Excluded from income entirely
- Better than deduction if you don't itemize

### High-Income Phaseouts
At very high incomes, some deductions phase out. Charitable remains fully deductible.
