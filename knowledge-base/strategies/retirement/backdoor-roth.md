# Backdoor Roth IRA

## Why This Strategy Matters

If your income exceeds direct Roth IRA contribution limits, the **backdoor Roth** lets you still get money into a Roth IRA through a legal workaround.

## 2025 Income Limits (Direct Roth Contribution)

| Filing Status | Full Contribution | Phase-out | No Contribution |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| MFJ | <$230,000 | $230K-$240K | >$240,000 |
| Single | <$150,000 | $150K-$165K | >$165,000 |

**If your income exceeds limits** (e.g., $300K+ MFJ): Direct Roth contributions are **not allowed**.

## The Backdoor Process

Since there's **no income limit** on Traditional IRA contributions or Roth conversions:

1. **Contribute $7,000** to a **non-deductible Traditional IRA**
   - ($8,000 if age 50+)
   - One per spouse = $14,000 total for couple

2. **Convert immediately** to **Roth IRA**
   - Same custodian makes this easy
   - Do it within days to minimize gains

3. **Report on tax return**
   - Form 8606 tracks non-deductible basis
   - Conversion is tax-free (you already paid tax on contribution)

4. **Repeat annually**

## The Pro-Rata Rule (Critical!)

If you have **existing Traditional IRA balances**, the conversion is taxed proportionally.

**Example of problem:**
- Existing Traditional IRA: $93,000 (all pre-tax)
- New non-deductible contribution: $7,000
- Total IRA: $100,000
- Non-deductible portion: 7%
- Convert $7,000: Only $490 is tax-free, $6,510 is taxable

**Solution**: Roll existing Traditional IRA into your 401(k) before doing backdoor Roth. Then your Traditional IRA is empty, and conversion is tax-free.

## Step-by-Step Action Plan

### If you have NO Traditional IRA balance:
1. Open Traditional IRA (if not already open)
2. Contribute $7,000 (non-deductible)
3. Wait a few days (let it settle)
4. Convert entire balance to Roth IRA
5. File Form 8606 with tax return
6. Repeat for spouse

### If you HAVE Traditional IRA balance:
1. Check if 401(k) accepts rollovers
2. Roll Traditional IRA → 401(k) ("reverse rollover")
3. Now Traditional IRA is $0
4. Proceed with backdoor Roth
5. File Form 8606

## Timeline

| Action | Deadline |
|--------|----------|
| 2025 contribution | April 15, 2026 |
| Conversion | Anytime (sooner = less gains to tax) |
| Form 8606 | With 2025 tax return |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting Form 8606** — IRS may think conversion is fully taxable
2. **Ignoring pro-rata rule** — Creates unexpected tax bill
3. **Waiting too long to convert** — Gains in Traditional IRA are taxable
4. **Doing it wrong order** — Contribute first, THEN convert

## Both Spouses Can Do This

Each spouse can contribute $7,000 to their own Traditional IRA and convert:
- **Total Roth contribution**: $14,000/year
- **Over 20 years**: $280,000 + tax-free growth

## Mega Backdoor Roth (Advanced)

If your 401(k) plan allows **after-tax contributions**:
- Contribute after-tax money beyond $23,500 limit
- Convert to Roth (in-plan or rollover)
- **Up to ~$46,500 additional** Roth space

Check with your 401(k) plan administrator.

## Example Situation

If your profile shows:
- Income: Well above Roth limits
- Roth IRA: Exists but no current year contribution
- Traditional IRA: None (good — no pro-rata issue)

**Recommended action**:
1. Contribute $7,000 each (you + spouse if MFJ) = $14,000 total
2. Convert to Roth immediately
3. Deadline: April 15 of following year
