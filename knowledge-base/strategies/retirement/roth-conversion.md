# Roth Conversion Opportunity

## Why This Strategy Matters

Roth conversions let you:
- **Pay taxes now** at known rates
- **Lock in tax-free growth** forever
- **Eliminate RMDs** (Roth IRAs have no required distributions)
- **Pass tax-free wealth** to heirs

Best when you have **bracket headroom** — room before hitting the next tax bracket.

## When Roth Conversions Make Sense

| Good Timing | Poor Timing |
|-------------|-------------|
| Lower income year (job transition, sabbatical) | Peak earning years |
| Early retirement before SS/RMDs | Already in top bracket |
| Large Traditional IRA balance | No bracket headroom |
| Tax rates expected to rise | Expecting lower future rates |
| Long time horizon for growth | Need funds within 5 years |

## Calculating Bracket Headroom

```
2025 MFJ Brackets:
- 10%: $0 - $23,850
- 12%: $23,851 - $96,950
- 22%: $96,951 - $206,700
- 24%: $206,701 - $394,600
- 32%: $394,601 - $501,050
- 35%: $501,051 - $751,600
- 37%: $751,601+

Headroom = Next Bracket Threshold - Projected Taxable Income

Example:
Taxable income: $385,000
Next bracket (35%): $501,050
Headroom: $501,050 - $385,000 = $116,050 convertible at 32%
```

## The Math

Converting $10,000 at 32% bracket:
- Tax cost now: $3,200
- If that $10,000 grows to $40,000 over 20 years (7% return)
- Traditional: $40,000 taxed at withdrawal (unknown rate)
- Roth: $40,000 tax-free

**Breakeven**: Roth wins if future rate ≥ current rate.

## Backdoor Roth (High Earners)

If income exceeds direct Roth contribution limits ($230K MFJ for 2025):

1. Contribute $7,000 to **non-deductible Traditional IRA**
2. Immediately convert to **Roth IRA**
3. Pay tax only on gains (minimal if converted quickly)

**Pro-rata rule warning**: If you have existing Traditional IRA balances, conversion is taxed proportionally. Consider rolling Traditional IRA into 401(k) first.

## Action Steps

1. **Project your taxable income** for the year
2. **Calculate bracket headroom**
3. **Decide conversion amount** (stay within current bracket)
4. **Execute conversion** with custodian before Dec 31
5. **Set aside cash for tax bill** (don't pay from converted funds)

## Tax Payment Considerations

- Conversion adds to taxable income
- May need to adjust withholding or make estimated payment
- Avoid underpayment penalty (pay 100% of prior year tax or 90% of current)

## 5-Year Rule

Converted amounts have a **5-year holding period** before penalty-free withdrawal:
- Each conversion has its own 5-year clock
- Applies only to early withdrawals (before 59½)
- Earnings have separate 5-year rule

## Special Cases

### Lower Income Year
Job loss, sabbatical, or early retirement = prime conversion opportunity. Fill up low brackets while you can.

### Large Traditional Balance
If you have $500K+ in Traditional accounts, consider multi-year conversion strategy to avoid bracket spikes.

### State Tax Considerations
Some states (like VA) tax Roth conversions. Factor into decision.
