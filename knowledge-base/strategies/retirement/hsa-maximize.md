# Maximize HSA Contributions

## Why This Strategy Matters

Health Savings Accounts are the **only triple tax-advantaged account** in the tax code:

1. **Contributions are tax-deductible** (reduces AGI like Traditional IRA)
2. **Growth is tax-free** (like Roth IRA)
3. **Qualified withdrawals are tax-free** (unlike either)

No other account offers all three benefits.

## 2025 Contribution Limits

| Coverage Type | Standard Limit | Age 55+ Catch-up | Total |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Self-only | $4,300 | +$1,000 | $5,300 |
| Family | $8,550 | +$1,000 | $9,550 |

**Note**: Catch-up is per person. If both spouses are 55+, each can add $1,000.

## Calculating the Opportunity

```
Gap = Limit - Current Contribution
Tax Savings = Gap × (Federal Rate + State Rate)

Example (32% federal + 5.75% VA):
Gap: $8,550 - $5,350 = $3,200
Savings: $3,200 × 37.75% = $1,208
```

## Additional FICA Savings

If contributed via payroll deduction (not direct contribution):
- Saves additional 7.65% FICA (Social Security + Medicare)
- On $3,200 gap = $245 extra savings

**Total potential savings**: $1,208 + $245 = **$1,453**

## Action Steps

1. **Check current YTD contribution** (pay stub or HSA portal)
2. **Calculate remaining room** to limit
3. **Choose contribution method**:
   - Payroll: Increase election (saves FICA too)
   - Direct: Contribute to HSA provider by deadline
4. **Deadline**:
   - For 2025 tax year: April 15, 2026
   - For current year payroll: Before year-end

## Special Cases

### Mid-Year Coverage Change
- If you had HSA-eligible coverage for only part of the year, limit is prorated
- **Exception**: "Last-month rule" — if covered Dec 1, can contribute full year amount (but must stay eligible for following year)

### Employer Contributions
- Count toward the limit
- Check benefits portal for employer HSA match

### Medicare Enrollment
- Cannot contribute to HSA once enrolled in Medicare (typically age 65)
- Can still withdraw tax-free for qualified expenses

## Long-Term Strategy

HSAs can be used as a **stealth retirement account**:
- Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket now
- Save receipts indefinitely
- Let HSA grow tax-free for decades
- Reimburse yourself tax-free in retirement

At 7% growth, $8,550 contributed at age 35 becomes **$65,000** at age 65 — all tax-free for medical expenses.
