# Maximize 401(k) Contributions

## Why This Strategy Matters

401(k) plans offer:
- **Immediate tax deduction** (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth)
- **Employer matching** — free money
- **High contribution limits** — much higher than IRAs
- **Payroll deduction** — automatic, saves FICA if Traditional

## 2025 Contribution Limits

| Category | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Employee elective deferral | $23,500 |
| Age 50+ catch-up | +$7,500 |
| Total employee (50+) | $31,000 |
| Total all sources (employer + employee) | $70,000 |

**Both spouses**: If both have 401(k) access, can each contribute up to the limit.

## Calculating the Opportunity

```
Gap = Limit - Current YTD Contribution
Tax Savings = Gap × Federal Rate (if Traditional)

Example (32% federal):
Gap: $23,500 - $15,000 = $8,500
Savings: $8,500 × 32% = $2,720
```

## Traditional vs Roth 401(k)

| Factor | Traditional | Roth |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Tax now | Deductible | After-tax |
| Tax later | Taxable | Tax-free |
| Best when | Higher bracket now | Lower bracket now |
| RMDs | Required at 73 | Required (but can roll to Roth IRA) |

**At 32% bracket**: Traditional usually wins unless you expect significantly higher taxes in retirement.

## Action Steps

1. **Check YTD contributions** on pay stub
2. **Calculate per-paycheck amount** needed to max by Dec 31
3. **Update election** in benefits portal
4. **Don't forget employer match** — contribute at least enough to get full match

## Employer Match

This is **free money** — prioritize capturing full match before other investments.

Common match formulas:
- 50% of first 6% = 3% free
- 100% of first 3% + 50% of next 2% = 4% free
- Dollar-for-dollar up to 4% = 4% free

**Check your plan document** for match formula and vesting schedule.

## Mega Backdoor Roth (Advanced)

Some 401(k) plans allow **after-tax contributions** beyond the $23,500 limit:
- Contribute after-tax up to $70,000 total limit
- Convert to Roth (in-plan or rollover)
- Result: Additional Roth savings

**Check with benefits/Fidelity**: "Does my plan allow after-tax contributions with in-plan Roth conversion?"

## Special Cases

### Job Change Mid-Year
- Can contribute to new employer's 401(k)
- Total employee contributions across all plans capped at $23,500
- Employer contributions are per-plan

### Self-Employed
- Solo 401(k) allows both employee and employer contributions
- Can contribute up to $70,000 total

### True-Up Provisions
- Some employers "true up" match annually
- Others match per-paycheck (front-load to avoid missing match)
