# Passive Activity Loss (PAL) Planning

## Why This Strategy Matters

If you have rental property losses that are **suspended** due to PAL rules, you have a valuable tax asset that will release under the right circumstances.

Understanding when and how these losses release can save significant taxes.

## The PAL Rule Basics

Under IRC § 469:
- **Passive losses** can only offset **passive income**
- Rental activities are generally **passive by default**
- W-2 income and portfolio income are **non-passive**
- Unused passive losses are **suspended** until you have passive income OR dispose of the activity

## When Suspended Losses Release

### 1. Against Passive Income
If you have passive income from:
- Other rental properties (net positive)
- K-1 passive income from partnerships
- Business income where you don't materially participate

Suspended losses can offset this income dollar-for-dollar.

### 2. At Full Disposition
When you sell the **entire activity** in a **fully taxable transaction**:
- ALL suspended losses release at once
- Offset the gain, then any excess offsets ordinary income
- This is often the biggest benefit

### 3. Partial Release Doesn't Count
- Selling one property of several doesn't release suspended losses
- Must dispose of your **entire interest** in the activity

## Real Estate Professional Exception

If you qualify as a **Real Estate Professional**:
- Rental losses become non-passive
- Can offset W-2 and other income
- **Requirements** (BOTH must be met):
  1. More than 50% of personal services in real property trades/businesses
  2. More than 750 hours in real property activities

**For W-2 employees**: Very difficult to qualify while employed full-time.

## Special $25,000 Allowance

For **active participation** (not real estate professional):
- Can deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against non-passive income
- Phases out between $100K-$150K MAGI
- At high income levels (>$150K), this is **fully phased out**

## Strategic Planning

### Track Your Suspended Losses
- Should appear on Form 8582 from prior year returns
- Track cumulative amount — this is a valuable asset
- Ask CPA: "What's my total suspended PAL carryforward?"

### Time Your Sale Strategically
If planning to sell the rental property:

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| High income year | Suspended losses offset gain, but excess hits high bracket |
| Low income year | Suspended losses release at lower rates |
| Year of job change | Could be ideal — lower income, losses release at lower rate |

### Generate Passive Income
If you acquire another investment that generates passive income:
- Suspended losses can offset
- Consider passive income investments (syndications, REITs taxed as ordinary)

### Cost Segregation (Related Strategy)
Cost segregation **accelerates depreciation** on rental property:
- Front-loads losses (more suspended losses now)
- Increases total losses available at sale
- Makes sense if you'll hold property long-term
- Engineering study required ($5-15K typically)

## Example Situation

If your profile shows:
- **Entity**: LLC holding rental property
- **Losses**: Suspended due to PAL rules
- **Income level**: Phased out of $25K allowance
- **Strategy**: Losses release at sale, or if you generate passive income

### Questions to Explore with CPA:
1. What's the total suspended PAL from the rental LLC?
2. Should we consider cost segregation while still holding?
3. If/when we sell, how do we time for tax efficiency?
4. Any passive income opportunities to absorb losses sooner?

## Action Steps

1. **Get your total suspended PAL** from prior Form 8582
2. **Track it annually** — add to profile
3. **Understand release triggers** — sale timing matters
4. **Plan sale year** based on expected income
5. **Consider cost segregation** if holding long-term
